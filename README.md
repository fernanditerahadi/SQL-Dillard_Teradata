These are the answers to “Managing Big Data with MySQL” MOOC quiz held by Duke University​,
the class is made available online by Coursera



In this MOOC, I performed a role of Business Data Analyst that is responsible for :
(1) Describe the structure of relational databases; (2) Interpret and create entity-relationship diagrams and relational
schemas that describe the contents of specific databases; (3) Write queries that retrieve and sort data that meet specific
criteria, and retrieve such data from real MySQL and Teradata business databases that contain over 1 million rows of
data; (4) Execute practices that limit the impact of your queries on other coworkers; (5) Summarize rows of data using
aggregate functions, and segment aggregations according to specified variables; (6) Combine and manipulate data from
multiple tables across a database; (7) Retrieve records and compute calculations that are dependent on dynamic data
features; (8) Translate data analysis questions into SQL queries that accommodate the types of anomalies found in real
data sets.

The data that was used in this MySQL Queries Vol. 3 was donated from a national United States department store chain, Dillard’s.
